We examine changes in the environment of wireless communications
research over the last two decades by comparing a paper written in 1991 \cite{oldpaper:rapp}
with a recent 2011 paper \cite{newpaper:rapp} and reflect on some interesting current research topics.

\section{Future Research Interests}
\subsection{Casual Environmental Monitoring}
As the cost of electronics goes down, applications that might have been
absurdly costly in the past seem plausible.  One such application might be
widespread monitoring of our living environment in radically more detail
than we have had in the past.  Today, a new arrival in New York City 
looking for an apartment might look at crime heatmaps, maps of businesses,
maps of language use, and typical price maps.  What if that renter could 
look at maps of how noise levels on his prospective block change over a typical
day?  What if he could know how air pollution changes with the wind direction?
In Java and Indonesia, researchers are considering using low-cost battery powered
sensing kits for vital warning of natural disasters as well as ecological
sensing \cite{envmon:wira}.  Their prototype kits monitor water level and provide
a camera feed, with the goal of being an early warning system for floods coming
down a river.  Closer to home, earphone

system might use APRS telemetry at very small sensing nodes, and use larger
data collection nodes connected to the internet to aggregate the telemetry
and send it to a central server.
The conclusion goes here.
